Keyro: Arena Lockdown was originally created by Erik Letson in March of 2016 as part of the [One Game A Month Challenge](http://www.onegameamonth.com/).
It actually began life as a totally unrelated fishing game, but was repurposed to become what it is now. Keyro
was formerly only available as an embedded game on certain websites. It is being released here as part of the
process of relicensing this game under CC0.
